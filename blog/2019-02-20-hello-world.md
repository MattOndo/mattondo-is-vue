I don't consider myself a blogger or a writer by any means. I'm a developer, and after years of neglecting my own website I've decided to do something about it. You'll have to forgive me for my terrible writing skills, and the spontaneous and infrequent posting of new content here moving forward. But hey, I'm going to give it a go! This first post is (selfishly) for my own benefit and used to dial in my typography styles.

# Heading 1

## Horizontal Rules

## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> >
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.

## Lists

- Sub-lists:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
